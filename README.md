# Refreshing React Skills

This project is a small project for review and revisit different skill set that I am working currently.

# Goals to achieve in this project
 - Manage the state of the whole app only with hooks.
 - Have 100% the code covered with unit tests
 - Learn cypress to do implement the integration test
 - Learn react query 
 - Have a functional and pretty to use todo list (like the other 10^90000 that already exists) :laughing:
